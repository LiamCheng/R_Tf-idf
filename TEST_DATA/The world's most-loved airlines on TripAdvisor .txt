While we used to wait until the plane touched down before we began logging our vacation's every meal, every hotel and every landmark, the launch this month of TripAdvisor's new airline reviews service means the sharing starts at check-in. 
Harnessing the power of its global community of 350 million users, the new platform features flight reviews from 48 countries in 29 languages and covers every major carrier worldwide. 
As well as rating flights in eight categories, including legroom, seat comfort, and food and beverage, and in-flight entertainment, reviewers can upload photos. 
Be it a limp salad, scandalously scanty legroom, or chewing-gum left on a seatback, it all gets mercilessly documented. 
"We're quickly becoming one of the largest places to find airline imagery and cabin content in the world," says Bryan Saltzburg, SVP and General Manager of Global Flights Business at TripAdvisor.
"It really helps consumers see what they're going to get."
Flight-by-flight analysis
But rather than the rants that might be expected, Saltzburg says the reviews typically "skew positive, 3.7 on average."
Most posts are "quite well-rounded. When there's a delay it's about how well the airline handled the delay."
The feature his team is most proud of, however, is FlyScore (currently in beta). 
Individual flights -- rather than airlines -- are given a one-to-10 score based on traveler reviews, the quality of the aircraft, in-flight amenities and the duration of the itinerary. 
"It's different by route," explains Saltzburg. "So many different carriers fly different routes and different aircraft" and the seats, legroom, entertainment and Wi-Fi options can vary greatly from plane to plane."
It's to "help customers understand the true trade-offs they're making when they're choosing between their flights in a real live display." 
TripAdvisor's new platform doesn't give an overall ranking for airline performance worldwide. 
"I don't believe there's a tried and true leader every single time in every single market that's consistent, and static," says Saltzburg. 
"Flying and shopping availability is dynamic and our system is just as dynamic to make sure you get a very granular assessment of all aspects, including aircraft, and airline, down to the type of seat you're going to be in."
But with all that in mind, there are still airlines that are winning at the flight reviews game.
As of July 22, there are 34 airlines with a top-of-the-class rating of 4.5, 20 of which have been reviewed more than 300 times. 
(Five -- Maya Island Air, Cem Air, First Air, Kish Air and Next Jet -- have maintained a full 5.0 rating, but with only 22 reviews between them). 
Here are those top 20 most-loved airlines on TripAdvisor, with the biggest number of cheerleaders worldwide.

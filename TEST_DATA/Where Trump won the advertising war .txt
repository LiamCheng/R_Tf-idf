Trump's ad ran 116 times to only 63 for Clinton there, according to ad tracking data. A few hours north in Jacksonville, Florida, it was a similar story -- Trump, 99 to Clinton, 72. In all, Trump ran more ads than his competitor in seven media markets, including two parts of North Carolina where Trump advertised but Clinton did not.  
The new data, from the tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG, provides a small snapshot of what's shaping up to be a high-dollar brawl on the television airwaves, one where Trump has lagged severely since the general election began in earnest in June. Clinton's campaign has already spent $78 million on ads, with promises of another $80 million before Election Day in November. Trump's response so far is a $4.8 million buy that began Friday. Both campaigns are also bolstered by super PACs, and the pro-Clinton group has spent far more than the pro-Trump effort.  
The seven markets where Trump ran more ads than Clinton are: Orlando, Jacksonville and Panama City, Florida; Greenville, Raleigh and Wilmington, North Carolina; and Lima, Ohio. 
The Trump ad focuses on his core issue: immigration.
Clinton, meanwhile, had the majority in 54 media markets, including 42 where Trump did not air any television advertising. Her campaign is currently running ads in eight states to Trump's four states.  
Her ads have focused on the economy and Trump's tax returns.
Included in the counts are ads that ran from Friday through Monday -- the first four days Trump has joined Clinton on the air. The counts do not include ads run by outside groups, including the super PACs.  
Both campaigns saw benefits to advertising during the Olympics. Clinton ran 256 ads and Trump put up 47 spots on various local stations during NBC's coverage of the final three days of the games.

Trump is trying to make gains with African-American and Latino voters by routinely arguing that he would be better than Clinton for the longtime Democratic-leaning groups.
"What the hell do you have to lose?" Trump asked African-American voters during an event in Michigan last week. "You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed -- what the hell do you have to lose?"
The refrain has been blasted by Clinton's campaign, Democrats and African-American interest groups. Clinton's campaign tweeted, "This is so ignorant it's staggering," shortly after Trump made the remarks.
Clinton will headline the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute annual award dinner on September 15 in Washington, according to an invite from the group, where the former secretary of state is expected to contrast herself with Trump on immigration and the economy, two topics she regularly hits on during events geared towards Latinos.
President Barack Obama also will headline the Hispanic caucus dinner.
Two days later, on September 17, Clinton will keynote the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation awards dinner, where the former secretary of state will receive the Trailblazer Award, in recognition of becoming the first woman presidential nominee of a major party in the United States.
African-American and Latino voters are key to Clinton's success in November and her top campaign aides are counting on large margins with each group to bury Trump on Election Day.
And polls lean toward Clinton, too.
A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released earlier this month found Clinton beating Trump 91%-1% among African-Americans.
A Fox News Latino poll earlier this month found 66% of Latino voters backed Clinton, compared to 20% for Trump.

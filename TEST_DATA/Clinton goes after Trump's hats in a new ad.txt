The spot -- which is already airing in Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, North Carolina and Florida -- says Trump wears his hat "like a crown" but doesn't link up to its message, according to Kantar Media/CMAG records. 
The ad is the latest attack by the Clinton campaign on Trump's business record and mimics attacks Clinton has made against Trump for demonizing outsourcing on the stump while doing it himself to produce Trump products.
"He wears it like a crown -- Make America Great Again -- but Trump made his shirts in Bangladesh, his ties in China and his suits in Mexico," a narrator says. "In fact, the real Donald Trump outsourced his products and jobs to 12 different countries."
The narrator adds, "So don't believe the hat, you can't make America great again, if you don't make things in America."
Trump's red "Make America Great Again" hats have become an icon from his presidential campaign and in some of his earliest rallies, Trump would throw hats into the crowd. The hats are made in a America, a fact Trump has brought up repeatedly on the campaign trail. 
While most show him currently trailing Clinton, polls also show that voters see Trump as a strong business leader who would be able to handle the economy because of that experience.
Clinton has sought to undercut that perception by attacking his business record and highlighting his outsourcing.
"Now, before he tweets about how he's really one who'll put 'America First' in trade, let's remember where Trump makes many of his own products Because it's sure not America," Clinton said in a speech in Warren, Michigan earlier this month. "He's made Trump ties in China and Trump suits in Mexico instead of here in Michigan. He keeps saying it's not possible to make these things in America anymore. That's just wrong."

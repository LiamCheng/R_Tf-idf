The Goddess of Pop -- who has repeatedly insulted Trump on social media -- likened the real estate mogul Sunday to the two tyrants before comparing him to Patty McCormack in the 1956 American horror film, "The Bad Seed," at a fundraising event in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
Cher's comments -- part of an unscripted speech introducing Clinton to the assembled crowd, which warmly received the remarks -- were posted on Facebook before being reported by The New York Times. The pop icon was widely criticized for the comments, but she remained defiant on Twitter Wednesday.
"Had I Known I'd Get Such Vicious Hate 4 Supporting Hillary, I Would Have Done It Anyway," Cher tweeted Wednesday. "We Seem 2 b a Country DIVIDED. Its Like a Civil War."
Introducing Clinton at the fundraiser Sunday, Cher called Trump a "consummate liar" and an "insane and sociopathic narcissist."
She added: "I was thinking all the despots, you know, Stalin, Hitler, but then I thought, even though they said the same things -- 'we're going to make Germany great again' -- and it was at a time when the Deutsche Mark I think was 25 cents. And also, like, look at Brexit. These people just screw(ed) themselves so badly because they were angry and they didn't think it could get worse."
"So anyway, I just wish he'd fall off the face of the earth," said Cher, 70. 
A message left with Clinton's campaign seeking a response was not immediately returned Wednesday afternoon.
Cher regularly weighs into the political arena via social media, and she has been particularly critical of  Trump for his party's stance on LGBT issues.
She said he isn't genuine when he pledges to "make America great again," Cher said, accusing Trump of wanting to "make America straight and white."
Cher also used her 16-minute remarks Sunday to talk about her friendship with Clinton and to praise her work with women and children, acknowledging that Clinton struggles to connect with voters at big campaign rallies and events.
"You know, she is shy and she's not the greatest speaker in the world," Cher said to laughs from those at the fundraiser. "But this is what I believe and this is what I know. I know that she will work every moment of every day."
She added: "I just want you to know that I believe in her so much, I believe in Hillary so much. I know that if (Trump) got into office, our world would be the worst place. We could never, I don't think we could imagine how bad it could get."
